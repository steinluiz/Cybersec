# üîç Cybersec Scanner

A simple and educational Python tool for scanning common vulnerabilities on a given domain or IP address.  
It performs:

- ‚úÖ Quick Scan (checks a smaller set of ports)
- ‚úÖ Full Scan (checks a wider range of ports)
- ‚úÖ Banner grabbing
- ‚úÖ HTTP security header analysis

Useful for learning cybersecurity basics and testing services on your own infrastructure.
